	  Construction Service (ts name kinda bad)

	  Physics Service
	   		-Debris Handler				'|
	   		-Character Handler			 |	---- All separate Modules, but just come under it
	   		-Projectile Handler			,|
	  Particles Service --  Particles would be on the server, but the occlusion service would filter out any useless stuff.

	  Item drop service
	  
	  Weld Service
